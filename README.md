# ClassicHud

Asi plugin to transform SA Hud, interface and background menu entirely, cloning III, VC and LCS (VCS soon).

# Hud Editor

It also comes with a Hud Editor that lets player to edit a lot of stuff in the interface (be careful, Hud Editor is always overwriting data in classichud.dat without any undo possibility!).

# To do

- Display correctly SA Health Bar when Max Health grows up (only SA).
- Adapt radar plane.
- Base Colours (for coloured low/high priority texts).
- ~~Colouring Spheres/Markers~~.
- Avoid show armour when oxygen is displaying.
- Manage radiostation icons in audio settings.
- Manage radar blip icons on expanded fla.
- Manage weapons on expanded fla.
- The another ClassicHud mod is drawing an "You are here" VC/VCS styled icon on radar screen. Find out how to do that.
- Enhance data reading from dat file, like Mobile Hud does.
- Is there a way of drawing better radars (specially when using Limit adjusters to increase map size)? See FLA source code.
- Adjust color (and arrow) of racing Checkpoints. Test Aerial racing checkpoints! GTA III Should use coronas instead of markers in checkpoints.
