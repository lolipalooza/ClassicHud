Asi plugin to transform SA Hud, interface and background menu entirely, cloning III, VC and LCS (VCS soon).
It also comes with a Hud Editor that lets player to edit a lot of stuff in the interface (be careful, Hud Editor is always overwriting data in classichud.dat without any undo possibility!).

- Manage radiostation icons in audio settings.
- Manage radar blip icons on expanded fla.
- Manage weapons on expanded fla.
- The another ClassicHud mod is drawing an "You are here" VC/VCS styled icon on radar screen. Find out how to do that.
